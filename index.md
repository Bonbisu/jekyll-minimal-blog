Hi! My name s Fernando Costa, and I'm a fullstack develper living in SÃ£o Paulo.

I'm a very curious and creative guy who love to inovate while learn some new thing.
My skill set includes Python, Javascript, HTML + CSS. I also know some web frameworks like Django, React, Bootstrap, SQL and NoSQL databases.
I'm very intersted about 3d modeling, rendering, animation. Sometimes I chill out studying how to make games, music and arts.
